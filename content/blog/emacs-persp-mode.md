Perspective mode (persp mode) in emacs allows you to save the layout of the tabs, windows and
buffers as named "persepctives". This can be very useful for different setups
for personal projects or work or even for one persepctive that you can reload
each time you start up emacs.

You can access the [persepctive mode commands](https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el#key) using: <kbd>C-c p</kbd>
