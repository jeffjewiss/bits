There's pretty good [browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-caret-color)
for changing the caret color: the visible indicator for text input found on
`<input>`, `<textarea>` and other elements. You can read more about it on the
[Mozilla developer site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caret-color).

```css
caret-color: red;
``````
